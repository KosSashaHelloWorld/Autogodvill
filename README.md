# Auto Godvill (in development)

Full rework of old project 'GodVillage'

The purpose is to create godvill autoplayer. It uses godvill api. So that means refresh rate is 1 per minute. Supports Qt UI elements. Feel free to branch.

## Specs

Developing on **Linux** machine (Ubuntu 24.04LTS). That means all the release binaries will be posted just for Ubuntu. Will create **Windows** support in future.

* Qt6.9-Desktop share lib (build with gcc 15.2.0)
* Compile and build with Clang-20
* Langs: ru_RU, en_US

## Development steps:

1. Get api string (done)
2. UI (done)
3. Parse api string (done)
4. Polling (in dev)
5. Actions
6. Automatic actions
7. Design
